# Case 
## The case is used to protect the computer parts from dust and physical damage. 

Cases come in many shapes and sizes. One of the most important aspects of a computer case is how well it can take in air and move air out.
If a computer is unable to move the hot air out, then the parts will be hotter and performance can be impacted.
