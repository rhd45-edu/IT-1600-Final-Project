# Central Processing Unit (CPU) 
## A CPU is the processing unit that handles instructions and logic from computer software and interactions between other computer parts.

There are two main companies that manufacture CPUs: Intel and AMD.  

Both companies have different motherboard sockets, supported technologies, and architectures that allow them to have different levels of performance.
It is important to compare the differences between CPUs and brands in order to meet your individual needs.
